These work by fetching map ""tiles"" from a tile server, and there are several of these to choose from too (the main OpenStreetMap server is not the only option) Some developers may be looking for data downloads. You can download the entire planet's worth of map data from planet.openstreetmap.org, and keep in syc with community map updates, using the ""diff"" downloads. Or you can download smaller more manageable country-sized, or city-size ""extracts"" of OpenStreetMap data. We do have a thing called the ""OpenStreetMap API"". This provides read and write operations on the raw map data of the OpenStreetMap database. It is actually primarily for OpenStreetMap editing software, and although any developers can create a new editor tool, this is not a small undertaking, and should be carried out with careful consultation with the OpenStreetMap community. In other words... this thing called the ""OpenStreetMap API"" is probably not what you're looking for! You can use the OpenStreetMap API to download small chunks of map data, but for this purpose it's also worth checking out some other options. In particular the OverpassAPI offers some flexible querying by tags etc, which may be useful for your app. Whether you're wrangling raw geo-data or presenting a web-map mashup, the possibilities provided by OpenStreetMap, and by third parties within the OpenStreetMap ecosystem, offer endless potential for geo map hacking fun!

The PriceGrabber XML API is a REST-based API, which means that you will programmatically get access to the PriceGrabber catalog simply by sending requests over HTTP following a specific syntax, similarly to how a browser retrieves a web page from a website. You will receive responses from the API in an XML format. XML is a standard that allows programs to describe data independently from the language or platform a site or application is running on. Because using a REST API requires some basic programming knowledge, including understanding of the HTTP protocol and parsing of XML documents, you will need to possess these skills or request help from someone who does to be able to integrate PriceGrabber data into your site or application. XML API Access: You first and foremost need to request access to our API. You will be given a partner ID (pid) and special key that you will use to access the API. You will initially be asked to send your API requests to a development server where you will be able to test the XML API and start building your application. Please note that this test environment is not meant to support a large amount of XML API requests. You should never attempt any type of performance or load tests, nor should you drive high levels of traffic to it. If you have specific requirements regarding the service levels of our XML API, please check with your account manager to see what options are available. Once you are satisfied with your implementation, one of our experts will review your integration and provide feedback, suggestions or request changes to make sure that your website or application is using the API correctly and as optimally as possible. Upon completion of this review, you will be granted access to our production environment and will change your API request domain. Getting information from our XML API is simple as calling the ??????search_xml.php??????? URL and passing a series of parameters that are detailed in the next section. Each parameter is separated from the previous one by a ??????&?????? sign and each parameter works as a name=value pair. Parameters have different meanings and purposes that will allow you to flexibly search products, offers or other content within the PriceGrabber catalog.",eCommerce,Comparisons

I think the api documentation (http://textamerica.com/api.aspx) is not
that detailed...
My first question would be... What do I have to do?? Do I have to send
the xml
&lt?xml version=&quot1.0&quot?&gt
&ltmethodCall&gt
&ltmethodName&gtta.Moblog.GetMyMoblogs&lt/methodName&gt
&ltparams&gt
&ltparam&gt&ltvalue&gtMYAPPKEYXXYY77XX&lt/value&gt&lt/param&gt
&ltparam&gt&ltvalue&gtMyLogin&lt/value&gt&lt/param&gt
&ltparam&gt&ltvalue&gtMyPassword123&lt/value&gt&lt/param&gt
&lt/params&gt
&lt/methodCall&gt
via HTTP post (or get) to http://xml.api.textamerica.com to get the
response? And the parameter name?
Than it would be nice to have also some get methods...
Ciao!

I have a IRC script for mIRC and a Google Gadget that uses the UD API. Everything worked perfectly untill yesterday. Seems they had a big outage. Now when I try and use my API Key it returns:
SERVER: Invalid key
Since the link to get a new Key is broken it would seem like they really do not wish to support their API anymore. I can't figure out why they would revoke my key for. While my scripts get alot of usage its not THAT many hits for such a big web site....I wonder if all the testing I been doing this last week while creating a gadget has anything to do with it?
Oh well I been thinking about making my own Slang web application. This will push me to do so.

The POI Finder took a lat long and gave a set of points of interests including businesses close to that point. This meant anyone could build services that allowed users to broadcast location or otherwise interact with their ""real location"".

The ability to write data about locations. Each API key came with its own overlay of the world and the ability to write data to this overlay. So, if you were writing an augmented reality game and wanted to hide a ghost at a bar in San Francisco, you could write the ghost to the bar using the API and all your users would find it there.
